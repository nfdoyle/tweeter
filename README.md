# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

All HTML/CSS from scratch, only Tweeter logo provided. Server uses ajax to submit and refresh the feed asynchronously giving the user a more seemless and fluid experience. Tweeter runs on a mongo database configured to run from the project directory but designed for easy deployment.

## Expected Usage

The server should be started from the command line, in the following manner:

`npm run local`

User can click compose button to drop-down a compose window to add tweets to the feed.
